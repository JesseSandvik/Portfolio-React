# Jesse Sandvik React Portfolio

This application is my personal web portfolio.

This application was built using JavaScript, React(React Hooks, React Router), HTML5 & CSS3(obviously), & SCSS.

I utilized React Testing Library & Jest-DOM for unit testing, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

# Installation

Fork & clone the repository, run npm install.

# Usage

I created this to showcase my projects, as well to offer insight to who I am on a personal level.
I want to be as transparent as possible with potential employers and clients.
I love engineering. I had a blast building this, I really concentrated on applying some of the principles
and practices I've read from various programming books.
I know this comes off a relatively easy front-end project, no crazy complicated API calls, I wasn't stuck
combating race conditions or strange asynchronous bugs, but I felt that I had fell a little flat with my
first portfolio page. I really enjoyed building this one and I will continue to add and modify content,
as well as develop more comprehensive tests while I grow as a developer.

I take critism well, I don't expect to ever know everything. We're all still learning.

Thank you for stopping by, have a great day!
