                During my time at Thinkful, I learned the concepts and skills necessary to become a successful, impactful software developer. From working through complex <b>algorithms</b> and <b>data structures</b>, to <b>RESTFUL API</b> principles and the concept of <b>test-driven development</b>,
                I believe that I have developed a solid, well-rounded foundation with which to build upon and grow as a developer.</p>
